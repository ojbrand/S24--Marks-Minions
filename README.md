## Project Description:
The Personal Media Journal project, designed & implemented by Mark's Minions, aims to enhance users' media consumption experience through a customizable application. This app allows users to receive media recommendations based on their mood, filter media by type, review the media they've consumed, & personalize their profiles with favorite media selections. This is a personal journal designed solely for the user themselves. The app includes various features distributed across 8 main screens broken up into 4 categories:

1. **Profile**: This is where a user can view information about oneself & set goals. The first screen will showcase a user's profile, displaying details about Mood, Logs, Journal Entries, & Goals. The second screen will show another example of how the profile can be displayed.
2. **Home**: This is where a user can customize their UI & view recommendations. The first screen will show daily recommendations, & the second will show mood recommendations.
3. **Logging**: This is where a user can input reviews and journals. The first will be a review screen & the second will be the journal.
4. **Search**: This will allow a user to filter through results. The first displayed is a search screen & the second is the results screen.
